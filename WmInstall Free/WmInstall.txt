		History

5/4/03		Software list entry for apps was not working because of an
	incorrect logical test on result of Query mark file.
	Added Version header in Wminstall.rc
	Changed to release version

18/6/03     Problems with copying iml.ini and deleting iml.inf. Tried
		renaming inf to ini.

20/6/03 Decided to change the system to renaming any existing iml.ini
         to .bak immediately. Iml.inf as was is now called .ini when
	 copied onto the disk. This avoids the copying / renaming problems
	 that could not be resolved. They seemed to be due to the OS buffering
	 the file changes caused by WritePrivateProfileString. Only happened
	 on 98.

11/4/04  Added code the check that imml800 has an M0P3 entry since some early
	versions did not. Add M0P3 = 0 if it does not otherwise confiml will not run.

30/11/10  The free trial version required mods to this DLL
		Corrected a problem with CopyDevices. Did it ever work?
		Arranged that COMIML is not authorised at end of install
		Arranged extra Registry entry in MLGPIB key to keep track of elapsed time
		For COMIML we now have a None.imd file which is copied to the install dir.
		This is used in initial install to allow user to start Windmill with a no
		channels IMD device which will not generate errors.
		This DLL must change the path of the IMD file to the install directory.
