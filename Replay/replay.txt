4/4/03		Added code to change working directory to iml default.
	did this rather than override the file open dialog which seemed
	hard work. Used _chdir.
	Added new version block which it claimed was a duplicate resource
	Seems there was a .rc2 file in the resource dir which only contained
	a version block. Commented it out and renamed the file .rcx. Seems
	happy using new resouce block
	Changed about box to 6.00.
	Put new version in release files.


2/2/11	Version 7.00 Changed for new release

29/9/11  Version 7.01  Added new help arrangements
