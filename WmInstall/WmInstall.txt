		History

5/4/03		Software list entry for apps was not working because of an
	incorrect logical test on result of Query mark file.
	Added Version header in Wminstall.rc
	Changed to release version

18/6/03     Problems with copying iml.ini and deleting iml.inf. Tried
		renaming inf to ini.

20/6/03 Decided to change the system to renaming any existing iml.ini
         to .bak immediately. Iml.inf as was is now called .ini when
	 copied onto the disk. This avoids the copying / renaming problems
	 that could not be resolved. They seemed to be due to the OS buffering
	 the file changes caused by WritePrivateProfileString. Only happened
	 on 98.

11/4/04  Added code the check that imml800 has an M0P3 entry since some early
	versions did not. Add M0P3 = 0 if it does not otherwise confiml will not run.

30/11/10 Changed apparent bug in WmInstall that would have prevented use of devices.ini

13/12/10
		Added code to install .sys files automatically
22/9/11 Removed above code since it was causing install problems
