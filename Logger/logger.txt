15\4\03 Changing for Procuro needs.
		Default Title made a string in the rc file.
		Windmill removed from several message boxes to leave Logger.

16\4\03 To modify for Procuro. All changes have been confined to the
		resource file. The file used by the project is lg.rc. A file
		procuro.rc has been created. Rename it lg.rc and save the 
		original as logger.rc. 
		Delete the lg.aps file before restarting the project.
		Right click on lg.rc and force a compile else the exe does
		not reflect the changes.

18\4\03 Further mods for Procuro. Needed icon changing. The original
		ones had a separate 16*16 version set to a default design.
		When an IMS file is loaded from the file menu then a default
		Title is created consisting of the App title + - imsfile. 
		Needed to allow for both default app titles. Compiled and 
		copied to release.

		release.

		trouble. Arranged to convert current _time to calendar form and
		then back again. If there is a difference we allow for that when
		doing such a conversion.

20\5\03 Improved the handling of filenames. Still need to resolve the
		opening of periodic files so we don't get _xx_xx. Also its not
