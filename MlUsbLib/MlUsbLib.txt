			History

18/2/03		Annotated and compiled. Had problems with release version.
Needed to set link options to default not maximise speed, otherwise it
crashed the computer with the 75X busy light on.
		Project moved to D:. Version on C: deleted.

4/4/03      Searched for C: references. Changed mlusblib.h to remove
a reference to imlinter on c:. Recompiled.
		Placed lib and .h file in the compile libs directory.
		Placed release version in V6.00 release files DLLs
		
5/4/03	Added Version Block. Copied to release

11/12/03 Problems with streaming caused changes here. We now send stream data
across USB as Header (2 bytes) + copy data + new data. This allows us to miss
a single packet and still recover. We now tell the mlusb driver how many bytes
to expect in the packet. We have a minimum packet of 128 and increase to 512 as
required. We then inform the USB unit of the number of samples of new data that
it can send in a packet. This is adjusted so that the packet never overflows.
The number of bytes in a usb packet has to be kept to a multiple of 2 or some
computers won't work.

13/3/05	Modified code to allow retries when errors occur. Try twice at the moment.

10/8/10 Version 6.03 
				Added code to stop hardware streaming before closing Driver streaming.
This in response to recent Dells blue screening.
