		History


4/4/03		Added test for 0 length string when calling GetIMLDir.
	Used by confiml to make sure we have a default dir specified.
	Copied to release files.
5/4/03       Changed version_string to 6.00. Copied to release

14/10/03    Problem with serial frames which produced error 22. This was
    caused by the message sent to ask for a reply timing out. It originally had
	a 5 sec timeout but I had reduced it to 25 msec to improve performance under
	error conditions. The timeout is surprising since this is simply an inter app
	message to which the reply can be not ready. It seems the handler is just not
	dealing with the message quickly enough. Increased the TO back to 5 sec.
	Recompiled and copied to release. 

Jan 2011 - 6.01
	The installshield adds a final \ to the imlini path and working dir path
	It seems that \\ does not bother file names much and things work OK.
	Confiml writes the working directory without the slash so that resolves the issue.
    However in the ComIML free trial problems arose since we use the working dir without
    first using Confiml. Modified the code to remove the unwanted slashes

May 2010 - 6.02
	Restored the WaitForIdleInput 2 sec delay on loading apps. Don't know why it was 
	commented out

October 2011 - 6.03
	Changed the start up delay to use a semaphore.
	Previous arrangement did not work.
	Arranged to test every half sec if all the interpreters have registered
	Will not return to main app for 5 secs if they have not.

May 2012
	Moved the mutex stores to shared data. Not issued yet
