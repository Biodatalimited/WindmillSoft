		History

5/4/04		Added message box to prompt user if he exits before defining
	a default directory. Copied file to release files.
	This worked in debug but not in release. Needed to clear the string
	before asking for the default dir otherwise the lack of a dir is not
	guaranteed to be detected.
	Added *.dir filter to Default dir to stop display of other files.
	Hopefully the .dir extension is rare.

16/4/04
	Small changes made for Procuro.
    To compile for them :
