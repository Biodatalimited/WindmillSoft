23/5/03 Added Initialisation Message button.
        Noticed that the cancel capability of the Mainform means that we have a problem
        when channels are allocated to messages which we later cancel.

6/8/03  Recompiled as version 6.00. Still need trying properly.


6/8/03  Discovered that in the GetIMLIni call I had forgotten to send the size
        of the data string ByVal. Curiously this worked on NT but not on 98. This
        was simply luck with the apparent address value sent. Made the changed copied
        to release. Gave version to Ben.

23/9/03 The com setting flow control combo was being wrongly initialised crossing over
	Xon/Xoff and hardware. It works ok until you reopen the form so if you just set
        it once then no problem.
	Corrected and recompiled as 6.01. Not yet copied to release.

18/11/03 Corrected fault which caused run time error if the user in channel details 
	 clicked on channel delete without selecting a channel first.
	Recompiled as 6.02. Not yet copied to release.

8/6/04	It is possible to create and allocate variables in parse and then not save the message
	This leaves the variables allocated to the message but not in the message. Can't then
	delete them. Need to examine this when we quit parse.
